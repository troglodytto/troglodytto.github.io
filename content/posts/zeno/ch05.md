--- **This post is a work in progress** ---

In the [last post](../battle-tested-bootloader), we prepared the foundations for our operating system. We set up a basic build system using Cargo and Rust, and we created a simple bootloader to load our kernel into memory.

In this post, we will explore how to output text to the serial port and how to use it for debugging purposes.

We chose serial since it has very few moving parts and we need a stable communication channel so even if nothing works, at least we'll know what's going on.
