I've previously talked about how I perceive the world to be a beautiful place in my [beliefs](../beliefs) page.

**But..** misery is unfortunately also a part of the human condition.

I see grief, pain, and sickness in the world, and it hurts me. I want to be gentler, kinder. I don't know what, I don't know how but I want to do something. Medicine, Food, Education, Financial help, or just listening, just by being there, just by being someone you can talk to, I don't know..

I realized _I_ can at least give it a shot.

Which is why I want to know, **How can I help?**

## How CAN I help?

If you guys have any ideas, anything at all, please do let me know 👉 [here](https://reddit.com/u/troglodytto).

What can I do? How can I do it?

Or perhaps you need something yourself (or someone in your general vicinity). If you have the need for any medication, or food, or you're falling short on something, perhaps you need someone to talk to?

Just shout it out.

It might not be enough, it might not even matter and make a difference, I might not be able to help as much as I would like just yet to or as much as you need.

But I want to at least try.

And not only just me, I would like You, yes **YOU**, the reader, to do the same. If you are capable, if you are more fortunate than others, relatively speaking, I urge you to try and do the same. Let's try and make the world a better place.

And don't forget to spread the word. I'm not asking you to share this page itself, or any references to it for that matter. In fact, create a page of your own, acknowledge others doing the same, encourage them to do so. Spread the word.

Here's a small list of things that _I_ could think of:

- Sometimes just being there, offering your attention, empathy, and a non-judgmental ear is life-changing. If you need someone to just listen. Please reach out to me at [my DMs here](https://reddit.com/u/troglodytto). The mail is just a starting point, and we'll continue to have a conversation on another platform that you're comfortable with.

- Volunteer at food banks, hospitals, shelters, mental health hotlines, community clinics. I'd spend some of my time and presence there. If nothing, I can at least know who actually needs my help. A sort of exploratory venture.

- Being kind, being gentle. I will try to suppress my primal and base instincts of violence, and anger. I will try to approach things with a gentler perspective. I will smile towards others, I'll try to make a child laugh more often, I'll pay my respects more often, I'll show gratitude more often.

- Being mindful of people in need. I'll try to notice the people in need more often, I'll show small gestures towards them. Even small things, like helping a child or an old person cross the road, or perhaps someone who needs my umbrella, or a lift. Just.. anything that can make someone's day just a little bit better.

- Donating to non-profits and NGOs as much as I comfortably can. I get that I can't donate all of my earnings, but if I can afford to go out for dinner, I can afford to pay for someone else's meal too.

- Use my computing power towards distributed folding. One of the many things the medical research requires is compute power. A few amazing people came together and invented distributed folding that can allow them to distribute that compute requirement across many willing participants. When I am not using my computer, I'll try to run the **Folding at Home** software to contribute towards that research.

- I'll try to tip more. Or maybe order something and tell the delivery person to keep it for themselves.

- I'll buy stuff from new and striving businesses. They need encouragement more than anything, even small purchases, small gestures, a small note to tell them, that their product is great, I will do that.

- Tutor people for free. I don't pretend to be the world's leading authority on the topic at hand, but if I can, I'll try to help you understand some topic you might be facing problems with. [Send me a DM](https://reddit.com/u/troglodytto) and we'll figure out when we can connect over a Google Meet session (about an hour or so).

I don’t need to solve everything tonight.

But... showing up, listening, giving what I can, or connecting someone to resources makes a difference. I intend to make that difference.
